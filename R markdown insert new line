# Add a mew line WITHIN a knitr chunck (or within a loop), to separate successive outputs (eg figures). 
# If this is done outside a loop, it introduces a page break.
# NOTE: you must include the option results='asis' in the chunk options in order for the cat function (esp in Word doc format) to read the symbols the way you want them to be interpreted within the document.

```{r insert new lines, results='asis'}

cat("\n")
cat("#####\n") # inserts a blank small heading
cat("\n")

```
